# App

this is a simple FE app to fetch and display weather data, and it communicates with [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## running code

- Pre-requirements :building_construction: :
  - make sure you have [**nodejs**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed in your machine (ideally Long Time Support version)
  - make sure you also have [npm](https://learnubuntu.com/install-npm/)
- Install dependencies:
  - run `npm install` which will install all app deps
  - run `npm start` to start the frontend server

## app deps

this frontend app is created by [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), and uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) to generate the UI and the different components. <br/>
To make API calls, I used [axios](https://axios-http.com/) combined with [React-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) <br/>
Testing was done via [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library] (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) <br/>
And styling was done by [sass](https://sass-lang.com/);

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
